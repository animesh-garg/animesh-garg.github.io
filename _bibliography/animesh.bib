abstract = {DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Frequency) is a system of signal tones used for telecommunications. DTMF uses two tones to represent each key on the touch pad. DTMF data transfer technique has advantages such as high reliability, constant speed, and high signal to noise ratio, low cost and optimal utilization of existing resources. These features make DTMF an attractive Data Transfer Technique. It finds application in home and car security systems, robot control, SMS and voice call controlled industrial applications. In this paper, we discuss the use of DTMF data transfer in a voice call to control a toy car. Cell phone 1(CP 1), which is at user end, makes a call to cell phone 2(CP 2) at the machine end and establishes a connection. A key is pressed at the user side. Two tones corresponding to one key are encoded and sent through the cell phone network. Both tones are tapped through the earphone jack of cell phone at machine end and are decoded. The output is fed to a Micro-controller. The Micro-controller is connected to the remote control unit of the toy car, which in turn controls the motion of the car. The car moves in various directions according to the key pressed user. The electronic circuit is divided into 2 parts. The transmitter side consisting of Cell phone 1 with an inbuilt encoder and the receiver side consisting of Cell Phone 2, 8870 DTMF decoder and Atmega 16 micro-controller. The programming has been carried out on AVR Bascom®.}

  abstract={Automation seeks to improve the reliability and quality of processes. This study aims to automate high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT), a radiation therapy that places radioactive sources at the site of the tumor using needles. Although HDR-BT has a high rate of clinical success in curing prostate cancer, it also has several side effects related to needle and dose trauma. A new planning algorithm from previous work optimizes needle arrangements using skew-lines (non-parallel, non-intersecting lines). This paper presents initial experiments towards an automated system for implanting skew-line needle arrangements computed from a planning system. We describe the interface, calibration and integration of the robotic hardware with the planning system, and present experiments using our robotic system to implant needles into anatomically-correct tissue phantoms. Results suggest that this system can achieve HDR-BT treatment objectives with reduced trauma to organs and low demands on operator skill, thus making the procedure more reliable and repeatable. In the future, we believe that robotic HDR-BT will improve overall treatment quality with reduced dependence on physician skill.},

  abstract={Brachytherapy is a widely-used treatment modality for cancer in many sites in the body. In brachytherapy, small radioactive sources are positioned proximal to cancerous tumors. An ongoing challenge is to accurately place sources on a set of dwell positions to sufficiently irradiate the tumors while limiting radiation damage to healthy organs and tissues. In current practice, standardized applicators with internal channels are inserted into body cavities to guide the sources. These standardized implants are one-size-fits-all and are prone to shifting inside the body, resulting in suboptimal dosages. We propose a new approach that builds on recent results in 3D printing and steerable needle motion planning to create customized implants containing customized curvature-constrained internal channels that fit securely, minimize air gaps, and precisely guide radioactive sources through printed channels. When compared with standardized implants, customized implants also have the potential to provide better coverage: more potential source dwell positions proximal to tumors. We present an algorithm for computing curvature-constrained channels based on rapidly-expanding randomized trees (RRT). We consider a prototypical case of OB/GYN cervical and vaginal cancer with three treatment options: standardized ring implant (current practice), customized implant with linear channels, and customized implant with curved channels. Results with a two-parameter coverage metric suggest that customized implants with curved channels can offer significant improvement over current practice.},

  abstract={When planning skew-line needle arrangements for automated brachytherapy, one objective is to identify a set of candidate needles that enter from a specified entry region, avoid specified organs-at-risk and sufficiently cover the target (tumor) volume. Existing methods use uniform or random sampling to generate a set of candidate needles, which may not adequately cover the target volume. In this paper we present an exact reachability analysis that can be used to guide the selection of candidate needles and to identify which subset of the target volume may not be reachable. Assuming linear needles, convex polyhedral representations of entry zone, organs-at-risk and target volume, we give an exact polynomial time algorithm for checking existence and calculation of the non-reachable set in the target volume. We perform experiments using patient data from 18 brachytherapy cases and found that 11 cases had non-empty occluded volume inside the target ranging from 0.01% to 4.3% of target volume. We also report a sensitivity study showing the change in the occluded volume with dilation of the avoidance volume and entry zone.}

  abstract={Automating repetitive surgical subtasks such as suturing, cutting and debridement can reduce surgeon fatigue and procedure times and facilitate supervised tele-surgery. Programming is difficult because human tissue is deformable and highly specular. Using the da Vinci Research Kit (DVRK) robotic surgical assistant, we explore a “Learning By Observation” (LBO) approach where we identify, segment, and parameterize motion sequences and sensor conditions to build a finite state machine (FSM) for each subtask. The robot then executes the FSM repeatedly to tune parameters and if necessary update the FSM structure. We evaluate the approach on two surgical subtasks: debridement of 3D Viscoelastic Tissue Phantoms (3d-DVTP), in which small target fragments are removed from a 3D viscoelastic tissue phantom; and Pattern Cutting of 2D Orthotropic Tissue Phantoms (2d-PCOTP), a step in the standard Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training suite, in which a specified circular area must be cut from a sheet of orthotropic tissue phantom. We describe the approach and physical experiments with repeatability of 96% for 50 trials of the 3d-DVTP subtask and 70% for 20 trials of the 2d-PCOTP subtask.},

  abstract={We present the design and evaluation of a novel low-cost palpation probe for Robot assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS) for localizing subcutaneous blood vessels. It measures probe tip deflection using a Hall Effect sensor as the spherical tip is moved tangentially across a surface under automated control. The probe is intended to be single-use and disposable, built from 3D printed parts and commercially available electronics. The prototype has a cross-section of less than 15mm×10mm and fits on the end of an 8mm diameter needle driver in the Intuitive Surgical da Vinci ® Research Kit (dVRK). We report experiments for quasi-static sliding palpation with silicone based tissue phantoms with embedded cylinders as subcutaneous blood vessel phantoms. We analyzed signal-to-noise ratios with multiple diameters of silicone cylinders (1.58-4.75 mm) at varying subcutaneous depths (1-5 mm) with a range of indentation depths (0-8 mm) and sliding speeds (0.5-21 mm/s). Results suggest that the probe can detect subcutaneous structures in phantoms of diameter 2.25 mm at a depth of up to 5mm below the tissue surface.},

  abstract={When operating in unstructured environments such as warehouses, homes, and retail centers, robots are frequently required to interactively search for and retrieve specific objects from cluttered bins, shelves, or tables. Mechanical Search describes the class of tasks where the goal is to locate and extract a known target object. In this paper, we formalize Mechanical Search and study a version where distractor objects are heaped over the target object in a bin. The robot uses an RGBD perception system and control policies to iteratively select, parameterize, and perform one of 3 actions -- push, suction, grasp -- until the target object is extracted, or either a time limit is exceeded, or no high confidence push or grasp is available. We present a study of 5 algorithmic policies for mechanical search, with 15,000 simulated trials and 300 physical trials for heaps ranging from 10 to 20 objects. Results suggest that success can be achieved in this long-horizon task with algorithmic policies in over 95% of instances and that the number of actions required scales approximately linearly with the size of the heap.}

  abstract={We present a study in human-centered automation that has potential to reduce patient side effects from high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT). To efficiently deliver radiation to the prostate while minimizing trauma to sensitive structures such as the penile bulb, we modified the Acubot-RND 7-axis robot to guide insertion of diamond-tip needles into desired skew-line geometric arrangements. We extend and integrate two algorithms: Needle Planning with Integer Programming (NPIP) and Inverse Planning with Integer Programming (IPIP) to compute skew-line needle and dose plans. We performed three physical experiments with anatomically correct phantom models to study performance: two with the robot and one control experiment with an expert human physician (coauthor Hsu) without the robot. All were able to achieve needle arrangements that meet the RTOG-0321 clinical dose objectives with zero trauma to the penile bulb. We analyze systematic and random errors in needle placement; total RMS error for the robot system operating without feedback ranged from 2.6 to 4.3 mm, which is comparable to the RMS error of 2.7 mm obtained in an earlier study for PPI-BT treatment using a robot with 3D ultrasound feedback.},
