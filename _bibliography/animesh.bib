abstract = {The Autotrix is an interactive, intelligent, Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) designed to serve in urban environments. Autonomous ground vehicle navigation requires the integration of many technologies such as path planning, odometry, control, obstacle avoidance and situational awareness. The objective of this project is for this prototype to navigate autonomously in an urban environment and reach its destination while detecting and avoiding obstacles on the path .This will be achieved by extracting information from multiple sources of real-time data including digital camera, GPS &ultra sonic sensors, collecting data from this extracted information, processing this data and send controlling instructions to our platform (Autotrix). The significance of this work is in presenting the methods needed for real time navigation; GPS based continuous mapping and obstacle avoidance for intelligent autonomous driving systems.}

abstract = {DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Frequency) is a system of signal tones used for telecommunications. DTMF uses two tones to represent each key on the touch pad. DTMF data transfer technique has advantages such as high reliability, constant speed, and high signal to noise ratio, low cost and optimal utilization of existing resources. These features make DTMF an attractive Data Transfer Technique. It finds application in home and car security systems, robot control, SMS and voice call controlled industrial applications. In this paper, we discuss the use of DTMF data transfer in a voice call to control a toy car. Cell phone 1(CP 1), which is at user end, makes a call to cell phone 2(CP 2) at the machine end and establishes a connection. A key is pressed at the user side. Two tones corresponding to one key are encoded and sent through the cell phone network. Both tones are tapped through the earphone jack of cell phone at machine end and are decoded. The output is fed to a Micro-controller. The Micro-controller is connected to the remote control unit of the toy car, which in turn controls the motion of the car. The car moves in various directions according to the key pressed user. The electronic circuit is divided into 2 parts. The transmitter side consisting of Cell phone 1 with an inbuilt encoder and the receiver side consisting of Cell Phone 2, 8870 DTMF decoder and Atmega 16 micro-controller. The programming has been carried out on AVR Bascom®.}
