I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) at [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and a Faculty Member at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I direct the UofT [People, AI and Robotics (PAIR)](http://pairlab.github.io/) group.
I am affiliated with [Mechanical and Industrial Engineering](https://mie.utoronto.ca) (courtesy) and UofT [Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/).
I am also a Sr. Research Scientist at [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/).

I earned M.S. in [Computer Science](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Areas/AI/) and Ph.D. in [Operations Research](http://ieor.berkeley.edu) from [UC, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu). I worked with [Ken Goldberg](http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/) at [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](http://bair.berkeley.edu). I also worked closely with [Pieter Abbeel](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel), [Alper Atamturk](http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~atamturk/) & [UCSF Radiation Oncology](http://radonc.ucsf.edu/). I was later a postdoc at [Stanford AI Lab](http://ai.stanford.edu/) with [Fei-Fei Li](http://svl.stanford.edu) and [Silvio Savarese](http://svl.stanford.edu/silvio/).

My research vision is to build the **Algorithmic Foundations for Generalizable Autonomy**, that enables robots to acquire skills, at both cognitive & dexterous levels, and to seamlessly interact & collaborate with humans in novel environments. [My group](http://www.pair.toronto.edu) focuses on understanding structured inductive biases and causality on a quest for general-purpose embodied intelligence that learns from imprecise information and achieves flexibility & efficiency of human reasoning.

<!-- My current research focuses on machine learning algorithms for perception and control in robotics. I develop algorithmic methods to enable efficient robot learning for long-term sequential tasks through Generalizable Autonomy. The principal focus of my research is to understand representations and algorithms to enable the efficiency and generality of learning for interaction in Autonomymous agents. -->

**Research Interests**: Robotics, Reinforcement Learning & Optimal Control, Computer Vision  
**Current Applications**: Mobile-Manipulation in Retail/Warehouse, personal, and surgical robotics.
