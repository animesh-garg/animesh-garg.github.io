I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) at [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and a Faculty Member at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I direct the UofT [People, AI and Robotics (PAIR)](http://pairlab.github.io/) group.
I am affiliated with [Mechanical and Industrial Engineering](https://mie.utoronto.ca) (courtesy) and UofT [Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/).
I am also a Sr. Research Scientist at [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/).

I earned M.S. in [Computer Science](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Areas/AI/) and Ph.D. in [Operations Research](http://ieor.berkeley.edu) from the [UC, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu). I worked with [Ken Goldberg](http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/) in the [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](http://bair.berkeley.edu) group. I also worked closely with [Pieter Abbeel](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel), [Alper Atamturk](http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~atamturk/) & [UCSF Radiation Oncology](http://radonc.ucsf.edu/). I was also a postdoc at [Stanford AI Lab](http://ai.stanford.edu/) with [Fei-Fei Li](http://svl.stanford.edu) and [Silvio Savarese](http://svl.stanford.edu/silvio/).

My current research focuses on machine learning algorithms for perception and control in robotics. I develop algorithmic methods to enable efficient robot learning for long-term sequential tasks through Generalizable Autonomy. The principal focus of my research is to understand representations and algorithms to enable the efficiency and generality of learning for interaction in autonomous agents.

**Research Interests**: Robotics, Reinforcement Learning & Optimal Control, Computer Vision  
**Current Applications**: Mobile-Manipulation in Retail/Warehouse, personal, and surgical robotics.
